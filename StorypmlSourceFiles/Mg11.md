WebTitle{A trade-off}

For a simple helper, a set of pulleys, all the ropes supporting the load share that load. There are other helpers – for all of them, there is a trade-off between how much of the load you support and how far you have to pull to get the lifting done.
A hydraulic machine shares the load across a large surface. Just as with pulleys, you only have to support a small fraction. You'll find hydraulic lifts where there are heavy loads to be lifted.

You can also choose how much pulling you have to do by using a lever. But again there is a trade-off. Once more, you have to pull further if you pull less.

For every helper machine, choose how to get the lifting done—the trade-off is always between pull and distance.
