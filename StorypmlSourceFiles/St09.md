# WebTitle{Parabolic paths}

## StepHeader{a particular pattern}

Throw a ball, or jet some water from a fountain and it always follows the same path. That's because of the accumulations of velocity caused by the acceleration. Arrange the acceleration to be in one direction for the whole throw to get parabolic motion (the path is a parabola).
