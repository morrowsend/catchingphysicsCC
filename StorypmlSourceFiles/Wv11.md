## StepHeader{Adding vibrations}

If two vibrations are in step, then they add to give a large vibration. If theyâ€™re entirely out of step, then they add to zero.

The resultant can be huge, or nothing.

(If the idea of a wave can describe hearing,  then two speakers might make a quieter noise than one if you arrange the vibrations for the two to be out of step)
