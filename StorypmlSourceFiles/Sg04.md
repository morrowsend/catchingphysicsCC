StepHeader{Experiencing no light}

Now it's not so easy to experience no light whatsoever, to be QuoteThis{light-free}.You could try deep underground.

If you do go QuoteThis{light-free}, or at least it is quite dark(an underground cave or just the cupboard under the stairs), then take a luminous source (a torch!) with you. Use the torch to detect that lost ball by reflecting light off it. Shining a torch beam on a ball (or anything else) makes it a non-luminous source.
