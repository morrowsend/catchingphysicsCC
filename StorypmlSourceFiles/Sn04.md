# WebTitle{Useful tasks, making a change}

## StepHeader{Lifting, hauling, lighting, warming}

Consider a range of examples of tasks that make a change. You can make changes by:

- lifting(by hand, by electrical motor, using something else falling) 
- hauling(by hand, by combustion engine, by electrical motor)
- warming(by hand, electrically)
- lighting (chemically - candles or gas, electrically)

You can use different technologies and make trade-off choices for each technology about how to make the change.

In each case, make the change clear by describing a snapshot that captures the situation before, and another that captures the situation after.
