# WebTitle{Revisiting waves}

## StepHeader{Frequency, amplitude, delayed copying}

You describe a wave by setting the amplitude, the frequency, and the delay between source and detector (set by the distance and wave speed).

## StepHeader{To-and-fro and up-and-down}

The vibrating can be to-and-fro(longitudinal waves), or up-and-down(transverse waves).

### InsertGraphic{CPRmSineUpAndDownPID}{950}{400}

Electromagnetic waves, used to describe light, radio and radar as well as other radiations, are transverse waves.

## StepHeader{Electromagnetic?}

The magnetic vibration is at right angles to the electric vibration, and both are at right angles to the direction the wave travels.

## StepHeader{Polarisation and matter}

If the up-and-down vibrations are all in the same plane, then the wave is QuoteThis{polarised}.

### InsertGraphic{CPRmPolarisationPID}{600}{600}

Light that bounces off water or snow is polarised: that's why Polaroid sunglasses work so well for skiers, sailors and anglers. Light from lamps and torches is usually unpolarised.
