## StepHeader{Making up journeys}

A journey is made up of different legs … just like giving directions.

JustSpeak{First you go to the post office, then turn left until you come to the house with the red gate, walk another eighty metres, and it’s on your left}.

Physics is simpler. Each leg is a straight line: set the direction and distance using the pucks.

Every journey is a collection of legs. To get curves, put in many short legs, with a small turn between each. If you’re not sure how this works, imagine walking along a curved pavement, step by step. Each step is straight, but link them to get a curve.

## StepHeader{Taking a point of view}

See a journey from different points of view – remember it’s the same journey. Changing where you choose to see the journey from doesn’t change the journey.

Each point of view is a choice – you can’t choose not to have a point of view. Eventually, you’ll need ways to find out how a friend, who has chosen a different point of view records the journey. For now, you can switch to a different point of view in the diagram, and see how they record the journey.
