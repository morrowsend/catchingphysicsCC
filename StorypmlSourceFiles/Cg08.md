WebTitle{Two kinds of loop: two patterns}

The rope loop and the electrical loop behave in the same way. You can think about the rope loop easily and use this thinking to predict what will happen in the electrical loop.

StepHeader{First pattern  SymbolEndash  current and flow}

In the rope loop, the flow is set by your pulling and your friends grabbing.

In the electrical loop, the current is set by the voltage of the battery and the resistance of the

StepHeader{Second pattern  SymbolEndash  glowing and warming}

In the rope loop, the flow and the push  set the warming. Because you don't get something for nothing, this also sets your QuoteThis{running-down}.

In the electrical loop, the current and the voltage set the glowing. Because you don't get something for nothing, this also sets the battery's QuoteThis{running-down}.
