## StepHeader{Copying with a delay}

Between any source and detector connected by a wave description, thereâ€™s a delay.

Therefore the vibration at the detector might be out of step with the vibration at the source (more often than not, if you try it out).

The trip time for the path between source and detector sets the QuoteThis{delay before imitation}.
