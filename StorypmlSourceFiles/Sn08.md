## StepHeader{warming mechanically, by rubbing}

Rub your hands together, to warm them. Still you can trade-off force for distance to warm.

Press the hands together hard, and rub a little, or press together gently, and rub a lot.

## StepHeader{Warming electrically, using an electrical loop}

Some ski-gloves warm your hands electrically. There is a trade-off here as well, chosen by the manufacturer, between current and voltage.

This trade-off is linked to the understanding of electrical loops developed by the rope loop model.

JustSpeak{Choosing a trade-offs to effect a change is available all over the place.}

There is even a trade-off in designing chemical hand warmers: between the choice of chemical and the quantity of chemical.

## StepHeader{Lighting electrically, using an electrical loop}

Bulbs are designed to glow, lighting the surroundings. How much they glow depends on the voltage and the current. This is not surprising, as glowing is a kind of warming.
