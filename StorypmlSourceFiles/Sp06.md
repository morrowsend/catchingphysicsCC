# WebTitle{Calculating mechanical power}

Here is another of the four calculations, each of which is a QuoteThis{pathway} for the power.

Whenever a moving force shifts power, expect to find a mechanical pathway: the pathway is QuoteThis{mechanical working}.

## StepHeader{Trade-off for how much}

Both force and velocity set the power in the mechanical pathway. So you can get a high power either by choosing a large velocity or a big force  SymbolEmdash there is a trade-off.
