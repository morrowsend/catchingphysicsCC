## StepHeader{Natural motion: no force}

Where no forces at all are acting on something, it's moving naturally. A spaceship a long way from anywhere is easy to imagine, but hard to do.

The lived-in world is full of useful things like air, roads, gravity, tables, grass and water.

Try and push something through water: it's a lot harder than pushing the same things through air (runners are faster than swimmers!).

Try cycling across rough ground: it's a lot harder than cycling on the road.

Put a glass of water on a table and it QuoteThis{just} sits there. Miss the table, and it falls until it meets the floor.

Motion is affected by any force exerted by the environment. These are QuoteThis{forced} motions. Things move naturally only when no forces are acting on them.
