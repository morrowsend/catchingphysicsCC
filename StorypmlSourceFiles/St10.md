# WebTitle{Setting trajectories: constraints and accumulations}

## StepHeader{A recap}

Remember (from the ) that QuoteThis{acceleration accumulates velocity} and QuoteThis{velocity accumulates displacement}. The displacements predict the path something takes.

Now you can calculate the acceleration from the force and the mass, you can predict the path by following this chain of thinking: a constraint, followed by two accumulations.

The quantity of motion is best measured by momentum, which is accumulated by force, so this gives a different starting point for predicting paths.
