# WebTitle{Calculating for photons and particles}

Here are the final two pathways in which you might find power.

## StepHeader{Pathway to identify what  SymbolEmdash  photons}

Whenever power is shifted by photons being emitted or absorbed, expect to find a hearting by radiation pathway: the pathway is QuoteThis{heating by radiation}.

JustSpeak{Power in the heating by radiation pathway.}

## StepHeader{Trade-off for how much}

Both the number each second(the activity) and energy per photon(set by the frequency) set the power in the heating by radiation pathway. So you can get a high power either by choosing a high frequency or a big activity  SymbolEmdash there is a trade-off.

## StepHeader{Pathway to identify what  SymbolEmdash  particles}

Whenever power is shifted by warm matter (with particles that are moving randomly) travelling, expect to find a hearting by particles pathway: the pathway is QuoteThis{heating by particles}.

## StepHeader{Trade-off for how much}

Both the number each second(the activity) and energy per particle(set by the speed) set the power in the heating by particles pathway. So you can get a high power either by choosing a high activity or a large energy per particle  SymbolEmdash there is a trade-off.
