## StepHeader{Electrical}

Expect an electrical force exerted on something charged when it’s close to a charged object. Re-imagine the thing extracted from it’s environment by choosing to replace the charged object by an electrical force  exerted on the thing.

The re-imagining is simpler, and useful if the tension force is chosen so that it has the same effect as the stretched surroundings that it replaced.

## StepHeader{Magnetic}

Expect a magnetic force exerted on a magnetic object when it’s close to a magnet. Re-imagine the thing extracted from it’s environment by choosing to replace the magnet by a magnetic force  exerted on the thing.
