WebTitle{Slowing down}

You're off on a bike ride. To stay safe, just as you set off you check the brakes. A bit squeaky, but squeezing the brake levers changes your motion.

When you squeeze the levers, many complicated things happen. Some squeezing, some slipping, some gripping  SymbolEndash  you could imagine forces(pushes and pulls) all over the place. But physics likes simple, and here is how. First re-imagine the rider and cyclist:

You want the brakes to slow bike and rider down: everything in physics-world above (did you notice that you've also isolated the bike and rider: the road, the hedges, the traffic are all gone. 

You could imagine other ways of slowing down  SymbolEndash  coasting to a halt, riding into a hedge or perhaps something less forgiving for an even more sudden stop.

Every one of these slows you down. And in every case a force changes your motion.

Only a force acting on you and your bike can slow you down. Just think of trying to stop on ice.
