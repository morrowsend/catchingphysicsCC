You hear sounds by detecting vibrations. Sounds can be either loud or quiet, high-pitched or low-pitched. Every sound you could listen to appears somewhere in this box.

These vibrations usually travel from the source, through the air, to our ear. There is a general pattern: source  SymbolArrowright medium  SymbolArrowright detector.

An explanations seeing uses the same source  SymbolArrowright medium  SymbolArrowright detector Pattern. Everything detected again falls into a box.

But what is detected? The best answer we have is that photons are detected. 

## StepHeader{Seen differently}

Physicists can count photons(but it is hard)  SymbolEmdash if it's brighter more are arriving in each second. The colour you see says something about the inbound photons, not how many of them. A spinning arrow best models this. (Why QuoteThis{best}?Because of what you can explain SymbolEmdash coming right up). Rapid spinning for blue, about twice as fast as the spinning for red.
