Tracks can be predicted. Split the journey into legs each one second long. To know where you’ll end up after each leg you need to know how fast you’re going( how many metres in that second), and in which direction. That’s the velocity, shown by an arrow. From where you expect to end up, predict the next leg in exactly the same way, choosing a velocity.

## StepHeader{Making changes}

You can learn how to predict tracks. Split the journey into legs each one second long. To know where you’ll end up after each leg you need to know how fast you’re going( how many metres in that second), and in which direction. That’s the velocity, shown by an arrow. From where you expect to end up, predict the next leg in precisely the same way, choosing a velocity.

For each leg, the velocity sets the leg length and direction. Over many legs, you build up a track even if you’re flying.

## StepHeader{another varying journey}

Another journey, but again you construct a track from legs – an accumulation – if walking.

You can predict the track from where you start and the sequence of velocities.

You can use precisely the same information to record a track.

Exactly the same building up of a track from legs – an accumulation – if walking.
