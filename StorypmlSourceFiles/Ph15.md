## StepHeader{A recap}

A photon explores all paths between source and detector. Each path contributes. By calculating for different arrangements of paths, you can predict:

- reflection
- refraction 
- propagation 
- diffraction 
- interference

You can design:

- diffraction gratings
- lenses
- focussing mirrors

You can predict all of these from a with a single way of thinking about the photon.

JustSpeak{Physicists delight in a simple way of thinking which predicts many different phenomena. Maybe you do as well?}
