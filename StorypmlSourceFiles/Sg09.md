WebTitle{Reflection of light(Exposition)}

StepHeader{Reflection from surfaces}

Light beams are reflected from surfaces in a very particular way. The QuoteThis{the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection}. This is called the QuoteThis{law of reflection}.

Instead of the beams you see you can draw lines to predict where the light will travel. These drawn lines are called rays.

This shows how an book makes a shadow, and how you can change the size of the shadow by moving the book or the wall. Draw such diagrams carefully and you can tell what will happen.

ListInformation
- Show the light source as a point.
- Draw two rays, as straight lines.
- Use an arrow to show the ray leaving the source.
- Use thick line to show the book.

Then the shadow is on the wall will be between where the two rays meet the screen.

Drawing rays is a way of working out what will hapen. These drawings are not pictures of what you'll see.

You can redraw the diagram to predict what will happen to the shadow.

ListInformation
- Move the torch closer to the barrier (the shadow gets larger).
- Move the screen away from the opaque barrier? (the shadow gets larger).
