You're surrounded by all kinds of different sounds. Just stop and listen. The noise from traffic or the sound of people talking or the radio playing is just QuoteThis{there}. You might not even notice. Sounds also provide us with information: identify a bird, a parent, when the kettle is boiling, when bacon is cooking too quickly.
