# WebTitle{Circular paths}

## StepHeader{A particular pattern}

Going in a circle, or orbiting is easy to arrange (at least in principle). You just set it so that the acceleration is always at right angles to the velocity, and not too big or too small. Then the acceleration accumulates the velocity so that it stays a constant distance from the point the acceleration is always pointing at.

As you alter the orbital speed and radius of orbit for the hedgehog, the acceleration you need is calculated.

The gravity force points towards the middle of a planet or star, and that force and acceleration are constrained. That's why there are satellites (artificial or natural).
