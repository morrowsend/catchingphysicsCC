## StepHeader{looking every so often}

In detail, here is what is going on. Every leg of the journey is one second. In that second, the velocity accumulates a segment of the journey: a distance moved in a direction. Add these segments together to calculate the displacement so far. That is, where you’ve got to, as seen from the chosen point of view.

To predict the whole journey, just add arrows, tip to tail.

## StepHeader{Adding arrows}

You can make each leg of the journey more than one second, increasing the duration. (You could make the duration very much smaller or very much larger). For longer duration legs, the chance the velocity changes during the leg is higher, so the riskier the prediction. But making the duration very short means lots of arrows to add up. Choose the duration to get an accurate enough prediction. Test the forecast to find out if it’s good enough.

The velocity and duration set the displacement for the leg(one segment of many that make up the track). Add this displacement to the starting displacement to predict where you’ll end up.

For tracks with many segments, just keep repeating this recipe.
