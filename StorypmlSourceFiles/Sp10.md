## StepHeader{To or from the electrical pathway}

One reason why there are a lot of electrical circuits about is that we're good at designing devices that switch from the electrical pathway.

We're also good at designing devices that switch to electrical power, for circuits that don't rely on batteries, like the mains.

## StepHeader{But why?}

You can't manage a process where there is more output power than input power: a device can only divide up what's available. The device only switches power amongst pathways. If it switches most power to a pathway you want (a target) then its a good device: if not, time for a redesign.

Power descriptions check where a process is possible, and guide ways to improve the process.
