# WebTitle{Momentum along a line}

## StepHeader{Force accumulates momentum}

You can restrict this accumulating to one line. Sometimes that can make things seem more straightforward. Still, a larger force, or a longer time, or both, results in a greater change in momentum.
Remember, momentum and velocity are vectors.

## StepHeader{Step by step}

Let time tick on again, and watch the momentum accumulate as a result of the force.
