## StepHeader{Pathway to identify what}

Before you set out to calculate power, it's helpful to identify what you hope to calculate. There are four calculations, each of which is a QuoteThis{pathway} for the power.

Whenever power is shifted using an electrical circuit, expect to find an electrical pathway: the pathway is QuoteThis{electrical working}.

## StepHeader{Trade-off for how much}

Both voltage or potential difference and current set the power in the electrical pathway. So you can get a high power either by choosing a high current or a high potential difference  SymbolEmdash there is a trade-off.

Since both force and velocity can be negative, so the power can also be negative.
