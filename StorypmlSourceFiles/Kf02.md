## StepHeader{You can make things move}

Use your hands to just push or pull a chair. You can put this another way: a force is QuoteThis{acting on} the chair QuoteThis{exerting by} you. It does not have to be your hands, you could use shoulders, feet or head â€“ but it might require some ingenuity to pull as well as push.

This pushing or pulling could start the chair moving. But catching a ball is also pushing or pulling, and stops the ball moving.

## StepHeader{You can stop things falling}
