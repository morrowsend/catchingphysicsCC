StepHeader{Light travels}

Light that helps us see. Light travels at the universal speed, whether from a light bulb to the eye or from a torch to the sock in the cupboard and then to the eye.

Light always travels at about:

300 million metres in each second
or:
ValueExponent{3}{8}{metre / second}

That's the universal speed, often called the QuoteThis{speed of light}. In deep space  that's just what it does. When light travels through air, water or glass (three examples of different mediums) it appears to travel more slowly.

Some speeds of travel: vacuum, ValueUnit{299 792 000}{metre/second} ; air, ValueUnit{299 703 000}{metre/second} ; water, ValueUnit{225 408 000}{metre/second} ; glass, ValueUnit{199 862 000}{metre/second}.

Because light travels at such a high speed, seeing books, cars and dogs seems to happen without delay. Only if you look at things very far away do you notice the delay.

JustSpeak{As we see, information travels from object to eye.}
