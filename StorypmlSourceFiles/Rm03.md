# WebTitle{Photons revisited}

## StepHeader{Frequency and energy, brightness and number}

You can describe what's seen using photons. That’s useful because photons are the simplest quantum object, and physicists think the world is best described by quantum physics.

### InsertGraphic{CPRmSeeingPhotonQuantitiesPID}{850}{535}

How bright a thing is depends on the number of photons a second detected and  the colour depends on the frequency of the photons that arrive.

### InsertGraphic{CPRmPowerFrequencyActivityPID}{470}{400}

The activity (which is the number of JustUnit{photons second -1}) at the source and detector set the power absorbed and emitted. 

### InsertGraphic{CPRmPhotonEmissionDetectionPowerPID}{800}{400}

Photons are quantum entities, shifting energy to or from stores in definite chunks. Therefore, counting the number of JustUnit{photons second -1} sets the power in the beam, for a particular frequency of photon.

## StepHeader{Changing the number of photons}

### InsertGraphic{CPRmVaryMediumSMDPowerPID}{760}{550}

Change what’s between source and detector to change the number of photons arriving at the detector. (A device switches power between pathways: source, absorber and detector are all devices.) The matter that you put in the way affects what happens to the photons. What happens depends on the energy of the photon.
