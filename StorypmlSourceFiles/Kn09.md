## StepHeader{Two step accumulations}

You started by describing a track as a series of legs. Next, you saw how adding arrows could predict segments of tracks, which predict the legs.

Put the two together to predict the segments and so predict the track.

To know where you’ll be, from where you started, check the displacement.

To know where you’ll be, from the start of the leg, check the track segment.
