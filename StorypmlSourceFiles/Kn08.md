## StepHeader{By interval}

Looking at the accumulation leg by leg, you can see how the acceleration for each leg tells the velocity how to change, and how adding all those changes together predicts how the velocity changes over the whole journey.

## StepHeader{Adding arrows again}

Itâ€™s the same pattern as velocity and displacement. You can decrease or increase the duration, with the same costs of having to add many arrows, or maybe making an inaccurate prediction.
